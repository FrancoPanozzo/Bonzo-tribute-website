        <p>
          John Henry Bonham (31 May 1948 – 25 September 1980) was an English
          musician and songwriter, best known as the drummer for the English
          rock band
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin" target="_blank"
            >Led Zeppelin</a
          >. Known for his speed, power, fast bass drumming, distinctive sound,
          and feel for the groove, he is regarded as one of the greatest and
          most influential rock drummers in history.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "John Bonham played the drums like someone who didn't know what was
            going to happen next—like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff.
            No one has come close to that since, and I don't think anybody ever
            will. I think he will forever be the greatest drummer of all time."

            "To me, hands down, John Bonham was the best rock drummer ever. The
            style and the sound was so identifiable to one person. Any drum set
            that he would play, it sounded like him."

          While primarily known for his hard rock style, Bonham's reputation as
          a drummer has grown beyond rock following his death; he is now seen as
          one of the greatest drummers of all time. He has inspired a number of
          great drummers.

        <p>
          John was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
          95' as a member of Led Zeppelin. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him
          first in its list of the "100 Greatest Drummers of All Time".

          Bonham used Paiste cymbals and Remo drumheads. His hardware was a
          mixture of Rogers and Ludwig, including the Ludwig Speed King pedal
          and Rogers Swiv-O-Matic series of hardware.

          At first enhancing his kit in live performances with timbales, congas
          and a cowbell, he soon settled on his trademark timpani, gong and
          ching-ring mounted on his hi-hat stand as the percussion in addition
          to the cowbell.

        <h2>His death</h2>
        <p>
          In 1980 Led Zeppelin had begun rehearsing in preparation for their
          North America tour. The rehearsals took place near Jimmy Page’s home
          where the band was staying. It was here where John Paul Jones and
          Benje LeFevre (Led Zeppelin’s road manager) discovered John's body, in
          the morning of September 25th. Bonham had died tragically from
          inhalation of vomit in bed during his sleep, aged just 32.
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous day Bonzo had been on a 12-hour binge drinking session
          that lasted until midnight, when he fell unconscious. He had consumed
          an alarming 40 units of vodka.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than replace him, the band chose to split out of respect. They
          said in a press release on 4 December 1980:
          <q>
            We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend and the deep
            respect we have for his family, together with the sense of undivided
            harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide
            that we could not continue as we were.</q
          >
          It was signed "Led Zeppelin".
