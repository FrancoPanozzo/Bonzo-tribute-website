DEATH

Rather than replace Bonham, Led Zeppelin chose to disband out of respect to their deceased bandmate. 
They said in a press release on 4 December 1980: 
"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend and the deep respect we have for his family, 
together with the sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, 
have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were."
It was signed "Led Zeppelin".
